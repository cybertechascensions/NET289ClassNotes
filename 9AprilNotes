## Interviewing Mindset Framework

1. Be Yourself and Know who you are
   - What is your intent?
   - If you don't know why you are doing something, you shouldn't do it
2. Understand the Context
   - Who is this person? (do the research)
   - What is their intent?
   - You are building a professional relationship
     - Don't go stalker/FBI agent on the person
3. Understand that you have value (comes with leverage)
